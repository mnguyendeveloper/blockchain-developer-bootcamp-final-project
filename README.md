# Monswap
Making the buying, selling and swapping of cryptocurrencies easy!
The simple crypto swapping Dapp with fiat on and off ramp for the easy buying and selling of cryptocurrencies.

# The problem
People feel intimidated in buying, selling or swapping of cryptocurrencies. There is either too much choice or too much noise in the market and they just need a simple to use Dapp with low fees and transparent process.

# The solution
I am creating a simple trading Dapp to keep things simple as possible and aimed at the complete novice. Increasing financial inclusion and accessibility for all into the cryptocurrency ecosystem.


1. User buying crypto
Create log in account for Dapp
Pass ID verification checks via JUMIO integration
User deposits fiat funds into Monswap wallet via bank transfer
Funds cleared into the Monswap Dapp account
User selects the crypto they wish to buy
User accepts/rejects the conversion rate (includes 1% mark up)
User then accepts/rejects the Blockchain transaction fee
A trade confirmation is issued
The crypto is transferred to user’s wallet 


2. User selling crypto

User then accepts/rejects the bank transfer transaction fees
A trade confirmation is issued
The fiat is transferred to bank transfer details
